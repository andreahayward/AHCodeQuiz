# AHCodeQuiz
For this assignment, I created 2 HTML files, 2 JS files, and 1 CSS file. I created an HTML and JS file for the quiz, an HTML and JS file for the highscores, and my style sheet. I chose to make the quiz about Drop Ship so that I could apply it to my job. I added 4 multiple choice questions and gave the user 60 seconds to answer the questions. During one of my attempts to capture high scores, I "broke" my timer so that it does now not stop at 0 seconds. I also could not get my code to work to capture the initials.
